Description:EpiSmokEr package provides a suite of methods to calcualte smoking score using whole blood 450k methylation data.
      Input could be either raw methylation data in the form of idat files or a methylation matrix in the beta scale ranging in between o and 1. 
      A sample sheet is needed with gender information to complement the methylation data. Four options are available in the package to calculate 
      the smoking score and predict the smoking status of an individual based on the methylation data. For more information and demonstration of
