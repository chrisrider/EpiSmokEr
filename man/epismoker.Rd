\usage{
epismoker(dataset, samplesheet, ref.Elliott = Illig_data,
  ref.Zhang = Zhangetal_cpgs, ref.CS = CS_final_coefs,
  ref.FS = FS_final_coefs, ref.NS = NS_final_coefs, method = c("MLM",
  "EM", "ZM", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data matrix of normalised methylation values in beta scale, with rows labelling the CpG probe ids and columns labelling the sample names.
In MLM missing methylation values are imputed as 0.5. In EM and ZM missing CpGs are excluded from the calculation.
eg: dummyBetaData}

\item{samplesheet}{A dataframe with samplenames as rownames. Must contain gender information as  "sex" column. sex column should be marked as 1 and 2
representing male and female respectively. Missing "sex" information is imputed as 0.
eg: dummySamplesheet}

\item{ref.Elliott}{This is used in "EM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 187 CpGs and the effect sizes used to calculate the smoking score
proposed by Elliott et al PMID: 24485148.}

\item{ref.Zhang}{This is used in "ZM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 4 CpGs and weights used to calculate methylation score proposed by Zhang et al PMID: 26826776.}

\item{ref.CS}{This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "CURRENT SMOKER" class.
In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.}

\item{ref.FS}{This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "FORMER SMOKER" class.
In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.}

\item{ref.NS}{This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "NEVER SMOKER" class.
In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.}

\item{method}{One of the four options as determined by the user ("ZM","EM", "MLM", "all")}
}
\value{
Returns a result object with the methylaion score generated by ZM, smoking score generated by EM and predicted smoking probabilities and smoking status
labels generated from MLM method.
}
\description{
A function to estimate the smoking status based on the Illumina 450K methylation profiles generated from whole blood.
Estimation proceeds via one of the 4 methods (MultinomialLASSO (MLM), Elliott et al (EM), Zhang et al (ZM),
and a combination of all methods (all), as determined by the user.

\examples{
data(dummyBetaData)
result <- epismoker(dataset = dummyBetaData, ref.Zhang = Zhangetal_cpgs, method = "ZM")
## result contains methylation score calculated using Zhang method-

data(dummyBetaData)
result <- epismoker(dataset = dummyBetaData, ref.Elliott = Illig_data, method = "EM")
## result contains smoking score calculated using Elliott method-

data(dummyBetaData)
samplesheet <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "samplesheet_GSE42861.csv", package="EpiSmokEr"), header=TRUE, sep=",")
result <- epismoker(dataset = dummyBetaData, samplesheet = samplesheet, ref.CS = CS_final_coefs, ref.FS = FS_final_coefs, ref.NS = NS_final_coefs, method = "MLM")
## result contains predicted smoking probabilities and smoking status labels calculated using Multinomial LASSO method (MLM).

data(dummyBetaData)
result <- epismoker(dataset = dummyBetaData, samplesheet = samplesheet, ref.Elliott =  Illig_data, ref.Zhang = Zhangetal_cpgs,
                    ref.CS = CS_final_coefs, ref.FS = FS_final_coefs, ref.NS = NS_final_coefs, method = "all")
## result contains smoking score from all the three methods
