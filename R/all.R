#' Smoking score calculated using ZM, EM and MLM methods.
#'
#' @description
#' Estimates smoking score using three methods: ZM, EM and MLM.
#'
#' @param dataset
#' A data matrix of normalised methylation values in beta scale, with rows labelling the CpG probe ids and columns labelling the sample names.
#' In MLM missing methylation values are imputed as 0.5. In EM and ZM missing CpGs are excluded from the calculation.
#' eg: dummyBetaData
#'
#' @param samplesheet
#' A dataframe with samplenames as rownames. Must contain gender information as  "sex" column. sex column should be marked as 1 and 2
#' representing male and female respectively. Missing "sex" information is imputed as 0.
#' eg: dummySamplesheet
#'
#' @param ref.Elliott
#' This is used in "EM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 187 CpGs and the effect sizes used to calculate the smoking score
#' proposed by Elliott et al PMID: 24485148.
#'
#' @param ref.Zhang
#' This is used in "ZM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 4 CpGs and weights used to calculate methylation score proposed by Zhang et al PMID: 26826776.
#'
#' @param ref.CS
#' This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "CURRENT SMOKER" class.
#' In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.
#'
#' @param ref.FS
#' This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "FORMER SMOKER" class.
#' In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.
#'
#' @param ref.NS
#' This is used in "MLM" and "all" methods. It is a dataframe with 121 CpGs selected by Multinomial LASSO approach, with log odd values for "NEVER SMOKER" class.
#' In addition intercept term and sex coefficient terms are also provided by Multinomial LASSO approach.
#'
#' @return
#' Returns a result object with the methylaion score generated by ZM, smoking score generated by EM and predicted smoking probabilities and smoking status
#' labels generated from MLM method.
